# MegaCorpOne Penetration Test Report

## Overview

This document details the findings from a comprehensive penetration test conducted on MegaCorpOne's network and web applications. The objective was to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them to assess the potential impact, and recommend mitigations to enhance security.

## Objectives

- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in MegaCorpOneâ€™s network and web applications.
- Escalate privileges and gain access to restricted areas of the network.
- Exfiltrate sensitive data to demonstrate potential data breach impact.
- Provide actionable recommendations to secure the identified vulnerabilities.

## Penetration Testing Methodology

The penetration test followed an industry-accepted methodology covering:
- **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information on target systems and identifying potential entry points.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifying security weaknesses in the systems.
- **Exploitation:** Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
- **Post-Exploitation:** Exploring and exploiting the network from the perspective of a compromised system.
- **Reporting:** Documenting the findings and providing recommendations for mitigation.

## Key Findings

- Critical vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access through weak password policies.
- Exposure of sensitive information due to misconfigured permissions.
- The potential for lateral movement within the network due to insufficient network segmentation.

## Recommendations

- Implementing stronger password policies and two-factor authentication.
- Regular patching and updates of systems and software.
- Enhancing network segmentation to restrict lateral movement of attackers.

## Conclusion

The penetration test revealed several security vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers. Immediate attention to the recommendations provided in this report is crucial to safeguarding MegaCorpOne's digital assets against future attacks.
